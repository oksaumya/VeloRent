## Tips for Taking Great Screenshots:

2. Clear your browser cache for clean loading
3. Use browser developer tools to simulate different device sizes
4. Use a screenshot tool that can capture the entire page (not just visible area)
5. For code screenshots, use a dark theme IDE with good syntax highlighting
6. Crop images appropriately to focus on relevant content
7. Consider adding annotations or highlights to important features

## Organizing Screenshots:
1. Create a folder structure matching the presentation outline
2. Name files clearly (e.g., `login_page_desktop.png`, `car_search_mobile.png`)
3. Process images to consistent dimensions when possible
4. Optimize file sizes for smooth presentation playback

When capturing the login and register forms, ensure they show the fixed label positioning and 30% layout width as per the recent updates.
